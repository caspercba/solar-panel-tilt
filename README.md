Solar Panel Tilt Html5 CSS Javascript

Author: Gaspar de Elias

This is a small website that shows what angles we should tilt our solar panels to get a better efficiency.
If the user wants to get 4% more power, he should change the tilt angle twice a year (summer & winter), otherwise, the average tilt angle can be used.

For this little project we used:
1. Webstorm ide
2. HTML5 to show some buttons, labels and canvas.
3. CSS styling for every ui aspect
4. Javascript: All the logic is managed by javascript files.

You can test it [here!](https://caspercba.github.io/solar-panel-tilt/)
